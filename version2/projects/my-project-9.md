# My Project 9

## Busy Course Load
*   The semester is very hectic, with:
    *   Two physics courses
        *   In the mechanics course, we are currently working with vectors, which I'm really liking because we've been using those vectors in physics too, as well as linear algebra.
    *   Two math courses
    *   A computer science course
*   So far, the first week has been manageable, but we already had our first quiz and a tutorial.
    *   This has highlighted the need to focus on maintaining a 4.3 GPA for engineering third year admission to UBC for engineering physics, which I aim to transfer to after Langara. I believe that if I can keep going with this pace, I can get there.

## My Current Focus
*   Maintaining effort on current academic load.
*   Acknowledging the flow of work.
