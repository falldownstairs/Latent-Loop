# My Project

*Notes for My Project will appear here.*

## AI Refinement Process
* Iterated with Gemini for the first hour or two to refine the LatentLoop concept and the live conversational note capture idea.
* Used Claude Opus and GitHub Copilot for most of the coding, specifically to implement features that automatically modify content on the screen.
* Encountered several challenges during the first implementation.

## LatentLoop Implementation Issues
* First implementation created a new section for every transcribed chunk.

## Minimum Baseline Requirements
* Ensure the system meets core expectations at least.

## Project Vision and Ideation
* Discussed core ideas and the philosophy behind the problem.
* Focused on defining essential project goals and capabilities.

## Live Conversational Note Capture
* Capture live notes and real-time documentation during conversations and interactions.
* Use AI to surface and scroll through relevant notes from previous discussions, particularly when circling back to earlier topics to recall what was said.

## Challenges with UI Animations
* Successfully established the general logic for the system.
* Currently struggling to correctly implement the animation layer.

## Future Simplification Plans
* Consider simplifying the implementation or project scope later on.
