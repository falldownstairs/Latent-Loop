## Latent Loop Journey Hackathon
- Building the Latent Loop frontend and backend for the Gemini API Prize and two other prizes
- Backend: Flask
- APIs: Gemini API (for the large-range model) and Grok API (to transcribe recordings)
- Participating in Journey Hacks with nearly 200 attendees; received positive signals from a likely judge who seems to really like the project

## Vector Database Integration
- Integrating ChromaDB for vector emulation and embeddings
- Finding similar sections to modify

## Similarity Score Thresholds
- Similarity score set to 0.55
- Threshold determined through empirical testing

## Optimal Similarity Balance
- Current score identified as the ideal balance for system performance
- Validated as the correct range for matching accuracy

## Meeting Response Capture Focus
- Shifting from a meeting summary tool to a "meeting coach" functionality following feedback from a likely judge
- Using context to improve conversational performance and determine how to provide better responses in meetings

## Meeting Coach Internal Logic
- Exploring the internal reasoning and cognitive process of the coach
- Analyzing how the system perceives conversational dynamics
- Developing logic to provide real-time, "in-time" feedback and exact phrasing based on what someone says to the user
- Referencing existing applications like Clue.ly that provide live response guidance

## Team Task Distribution Strategy
- Establishing a "divide and conquer" approach for project development
- Determining how to allocate roles and responsibilities among team members

## Judge Validation and Rationale
- Analyzing strong positive signals from a potential hackathon judge
- Identifying the project's unique appeal based on the team's specific build and experience
