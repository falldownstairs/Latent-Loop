# My Project 10

## Current Semester Workload
- Currently at Langara taking five courses: two physics, two math (including Linear Algebra), and one CPSC
- Managing an overwhelming workload; already completed a quiz and tutorial in the first week
- Aiming to transfer to UBC for Engineering Physics to be fully equipped for emerging technology; Engineering Mechanics is currently my favorite course due to its use of vector manipulation, a technique also applied in Linear Algebra and Physics
- Must "lock in" and perform well this semester to maintain the required GPA for the transfer
