# My Project 4

## JourneyHacks 2026 Project
- Currently attending JourneyHacks 2026
- Developing Latent Loop
- Motive: Enable live note-taking
- Backend: Flask
- Frontend: Template index.html file (planned transition to Next.js)

## AI and Model Integration
- Utilizing Gemini API
- Integrating Groq for inference
- Speech-to-text API for transcription
- Utilizing ChromaDB to find relevant sections by calculating similarity between transcription chunks (similarity score threshold: 0.5)

## Similarity Threshold Empirical Findings
- Determined 0.55 as the optimal similarity score through empirical testing and experimentation
- Analyzing the motive behind this specific threshold selection

## Enhanced Review and Understanding
- Enable users to review previous statements
- Facilitate better comprehension of past dialogue

## Secondary Project Objectives
- Transitioning to the second phase of project development

## Performance and Speed Optimizations
- Addressing system latency and speed bottlenecks
- Increasing update duration to allow more time for processing
- Planning immediate performance improvements
